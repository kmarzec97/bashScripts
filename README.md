# bashScripts
This is collection of my bash scripts I use everyday on my Dynamic Window Manager

-> amdFanControl - I wrote this script to easily control speed of my GPU fans. This script needs elevated privileges. (Tested on AMD Southern Islands)

-> wallpaper - This script sets random wallpaper from ~/Wallpapers directory. Script can be used as cron job.

-> panel.sh - This script allows me to display system info on DWM panel.
